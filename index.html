<p><b>History</b></p>
Durham House of Pets is a quaint pet store located in the heart of Durham. The owner and Creator of Durham house of pets is Elle-May, after she graduated from The University of New Hampshire 11 years ago she decided that she wanted to stay in Durham and open her own business. Since she had a minor in animal science she decided that Durham was in desperate need of a pet store and she was the one to do it. She started off just selling dog treats and food but over the years she has expanded to make things for other animals as well. Elle-May also wanted to do something that benefitted others. So a portion of the profits go towards funding the University of New Hampshires Vet Program.
